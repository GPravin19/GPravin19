## üèÜ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of. You can find more on my repositories page.

| Project Name | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| **Nissan Websites** | The Nissan websites (200+ worldwide with multiple languages) was built using a CMS tool AEM by Adobe. I developed some of their backend services, API Gateway, AEM components, caching mechanisms, ETL tools & Monitoring Tools with ELK stack, AppDynamics, etc. I contributed on various aspects spanning about 4 years. One Key contribution was fixing the Zero day Log4j vulnerability on about 19 Java modules in a short span of time in 2021 | [Sample Nissan website](https://www.nissan.co.uk/) |
| **Lloyds Banking Group** | I setup the API Platform for exposing APIs with all security mechanisms. This API Platform acts as their strategic method to expose any APIs in public Cloud including GCP & Azure. I predominentaly contributed in GCP, tech stacks include Apigee X Gateway, GCLB, Envoy, Kubernetes, Helm, Groovy, etc. I have also built an API onboarding automation tool which helps in quick onboarding of APIs from just submitting a Jira request, where based on the submitted request the APIs will be enabled to be onborded based on a automation trigger. | N/A as this is a platform. I can walkthrough the entire architecture and implementation on request |
| **TSB Bank** | I helped in building the API Gateway along with Mesh setup using Kong Konnect Gateway & Mesh. The Cloud used was AWS and the CD tool was Argo CD. I created some custom plugins, implemented the Mesh policies, Connectivity to the Mesh with mTLS, etc. | N/A as this is a platform. I can walkthrough the entire architecture and implementation on request |
